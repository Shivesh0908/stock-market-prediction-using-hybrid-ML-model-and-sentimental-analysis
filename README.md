Stocks are the shares of a company or the division of corporation. Stock
market is highly volatile and thus it has a high amount of risk and uncertainty
associated with it. These problems of high risk and uncertainty call for a model
that is efficient enough to make predictions on the future stock prices of
different firms. Although the stock market investments are subject to market
risks, a competent model which provides a substantial prediction will prove out
to be helpful. The existing models take into consideration any one algorithm
and hence are not accurate enough thus designing and developing an
accurate prediction model for stocks for long term investment using machine
learning algorithms and sentiment analysis is the concern of the project. The
approach of combining different models, known as Ensemble Learning,
provides a more accurate prediction than using individual models. \\
The proposed hybrid prediction model incorporates three Machine Learning
algorithms : Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) and Linear Regression and combines it with
Sentimental Analysis of tweets to predict the stock prices for the next seven
days. The final product is a User Interface which makes the prediction for the
closing prices all the stocks listed in National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). It
provides an interactable interface where the users can search for any stock
and make decisions on whether to buy it or sell it. Utilizing an ensemble
learning strategy is the reason for merging three distinct approaches into a
single feed forward network. Due to these characteristics, it is seen that LSTM
RNN is very helpful in learning long-term sequential dependencies.
The ARIMA model has a Root Mean Square Error of 36.51, whereas it is
73.53 and 97.28 for LSTM and Linear Regression respectively, thus making
ARIMA model the most accurate one. The hybrid model using LSTM, ARIMA,
and Sentiment Analysis is very effective at predicting the closing price of the
following day because it takes historical intuitions as well as current market
sentiment into account.
